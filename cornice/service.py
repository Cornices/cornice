    A service is composed of a path and many potential methods, associated
    with context.

    All the class attributes defined in this class or in childs are considered
    default values.

    :param name: the name of the service. Should be unique among all the
                 services.

    :param path: the path the service is available at. Should also be unique.

    :param renderer: the renderer that should be used by this service. Default
                     value is 'simplejson'.

    :param description: the description of what the webservice does. This is
                        primarily intended for documentation purposes.

    :param validators: a list of callables to pass the request into before
                       passing it to the associated view.

    :param filters: a list of callables to pass the response into before
                    returning it to the client.

    :param accept: a list of headers accepted for this service (or method if
                   overwritten when defining a method). It can also be a
                   callable, in which case the content-type will be discovered
                   at runtime. If a callable is passed, it should be able to
                   take the request as a first argument.

    :param factory: A factory returning callables which return boolean values.
                    The callables take the request as their first argument and
                    return boolean values.
                    This param is exclusive with the 'acl' one.

    :param acl: a callable defininng the ACL (returns true or false, function
                of the given request). Exclusive with the 'factory' option.

    :param klass: the class to use when resolving views (if they are not
                  callables)

    :param error_handler: (optional) A callable which is used to render
                  responses following validation failures.  Defaults to
                  'json_renderer'.

    See
    http://readthedocs.org/docs/pyramid/en/1.0-branch/glossary.html#term-acl
    for more information about ACLs.

    Service cornice instances also have methods :meth:`~get`, :meth:`~post`,
    :meth:`~put`, :meth:`~options` and :meth:`~delete` are decorators that can
    be used to decorate views.
