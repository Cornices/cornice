Welcome to Cornice's documentation!

**Cornice** provides helpers to build & document REST-ish Web Services
with Pyramid, with decent default behaviors.

A **full** Cornice WGSI application looks like this (this example is taken from
the `demoapp project <https://github.com/mozilla-services/demoapp>`_)

.. literalinclude:: /../../examples/demoapp/demoapp/views.py

What Cornice will do for you here is:

- automatically raise a 405 if a DELETE or a PUT is called on 
  **/{username}/info**
- automatically generate your doc via a Sphinx directive.
- provide a validation framework that will return a nice JSON structure
  in Bad Request 400 responses explaining what's wrong.
- provide an acceptable **Content-Type** whenever you send an HTTP "Accept" 
  header 
  to it, resulting in a *406 Not Acceptable* with the list of acceptable ones
  if it can't answer.

You can also have a complete overview of the builtin validations provided by
cornice in :doc:`builtin-features`


Contribution & Feedback

Cornice is a project initiated at Mozilla Services, where we build Web 
Services for features like Firefox Sync. All of what we do is built with open
source, and this is one brick of our stack.
