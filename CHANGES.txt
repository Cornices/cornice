CHANGELOG
#########

3.1.0 (2018-02-08)
==================

- In addition to the ``colander_body_validator``, there are now three more similar validators:
  ``colander_headers_validator``, ``colander_path_validator``, and
  ``colander_querystring_validator``.
- six is now a required dependency.


3.0.0 (2017-10-20)
==================

**Breaking changes**

 Please refer to `upgrading docs <https://cornice.readthedocs.io/en/stable/upgrading.html>`_ for detailed migration instructions.

- ``acl`` and ``traverse`` parameters are not supported anymore on services
- Constructors of resource decorated classed must now be ``__init__(self, request, context=None)``

**Enhancements**

- Align Cornice with Pyramid ACL pattern: Dynamic ACLs based
  on resource are now possible (#452, thanks @wjehenddher)

**Bug fixes**

- Disable CSRF check on predicate fallback view (fixes #458)
- Fix to use own validator for Header Accept (fixes #431)


2.4.0 (2017-01-19)
==================

**Enhancements**

- Add support for arrays on request body top level.


2.3.0 (2016-12-15)
==================

**Enhancements**

- Add support for validation with specific JSON Content-Types
  (i.e application/merge-patch+json).
- Add ``X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`` headers to responses (fixes #102)
- Add a ``request.current_service`` attribute (fixes #105)

**Bug fixes**

- Fix ``cornice.cors.get_cors_preflight_view`` to make it parse
  `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header correctly event if its value
  contains zero number of white spaces between commas (#422)

**Internal changes**

- Clean-up an inconsistency in ``cornice.service.decorate_view()`` function
  where ``acl`` and ``factory`` were expected as view arguments (whereas
  deprecated since 1.0)


2.2.0 (2016-11-25)
==================

**Enhancements**

- Add support of custom predicates in resources (#344, thanks @VDigitall!)

**Internal changes**

2.1.0 (2016-10-28)
==================

**Enhancements**

- ``Cornice.validators.colander_validator`` and
  ``cornice.validators.colander_body_validator`` now accept colander
  schema node instances.  Previously only schema classes were
  accepted.  For some discussion see #412.

**Deprecations**

- Passing schema classes to ``Cornice.validators.colander_validator`` and
  ``cornice.validators.colander_body_validator`` is now deprecated.
  (See above.)

**Bug fixes**

- To maintain consistency with cornice 1.2 as to the semantics of
  ``location='path'``, change ``cornice.validators.extract_cstruct``
  so that it places ``request.matchdict`` (rather than
  ``request.path``) into ``cstruct['path']``. (#411)

- Fix ``cornice.validators.colander_validator`` so that it does
  nothing if ``schema`` is unset (or set to ``None``.)  Previously
  (contrary to its docstring) it was raising a ``TypeError``.

**Internal changes**

- Raised test coverage to 100% (#417)

Huge thanks to @dairiki for his help on this release!


2.0.2 (2016-10-25)
==================

**Bug fixes**

* Exclude ``tests`` from install (#407, thanks @doctaweeks!)

**Internal changes**

  in favor of ``cornice.validators.extract_cstruct()`` (#409)
